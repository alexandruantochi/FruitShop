This is a project that I've done during the FII Practic event at the Faculty of Computer Science in Iasi with the help of the trainers from UniCredit Bussiness Integrated Solutions.

The project is partially not complete, as it lacks the "cart" and "checkout" functions. It also needs some refinig here and there, such as data validation etc.

Most of the code is written by me, to work on my MariaDB SQL database (check SQL folder) following the guidelines and model from the core project, which only had the "show products" functionality.
